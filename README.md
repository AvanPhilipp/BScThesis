All the codes of my BSc Thesis are stired here. The purpose is not to secure all the data, and for further presentation.

The base of this project is the convolutional network implementation of Dr. Zolt√°n Nagy. The files *"conv.cpp"*, *"conv.h"*, *"conv_tb.cpp"* is his work.
I started the work with the fully connected layer implementation.
